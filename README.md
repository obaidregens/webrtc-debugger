# webrtc-debugger

The debugger is hosted at [https://webrtc-debugger.netlify.app/](https://webrtc-debugger.netlify.app/) and is free to use so you don't actually need to clone it. Just paste in your own ICE servers config.

Nothing else to add, hope this is useful!

As always if you want to clone and run locally.

1. git clone `https://github.com/obaidregens/webrtc-debugger`
2. `cd webrtc-debugger`
3. `pnpm (or npm if you don't have it) install`
4. `npm run dev`
